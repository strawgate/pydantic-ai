# Pydantic AI Streaming Resilience Sweep

You are running under the **Pydantic AI harness engine** (not the Claude Code
CLI), driving a model through gh-aw's AWF firewall and credential-injecting
proxy. You have native `bash`, `read_file`, `grep`, `list_dir` tools plus the
gh-aw GitHub tools and the `create_issue` / `noop` safe-output tools.

You are working in the **Pydantic AI** repository
([ai.pydantic.dev](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)). The streaming/agent-loop code
is in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/` (`_agent_graph`, `result`, `messages`,
`run`) and the AG-UI / Vercel adapters.

## Objective

Find one concrete bug in the **streaming state machine**. Streaming is the
largest topical cluster and harbors hard-to-spot ordering and lifecycle bugs.
Pick **one** focus area per run:

- `run_stream` / `StreamedRunResult` lifecycle (early exit, double-consume,
  `get_output()` before/after completion).
- `agent.iter` / `_next_node` graph node ordering and assertions.
- `event_stream_handler` event sequence (start → deltas → end), including for
  tool calls and thinking parts.
- Partial / aborted / cancelled streams (network drop, `break`, timeout) and
  cleanup.
- AG-UI / Vercel adapter event ordering and terminal events.
- Usage / final message assembly when the stream ends or errors mid-way.

## How to Verify — mandatory

Use `TestModel`/`FunctionModel` or a recorded fixture to drive a deterministic
stream. Write a **new** minimal test asserting the **event/None sequence and
final message** — e.g. no deltas after the final part, tool-call/return
pairing intact, `usage` populated on completion, no `StopAsyncIteration`/
assertion leakage on early exit. Do not run and report the existing suite.

## What to Look For

- Events emitted out of order, duplicated, or missing a terminal event.
- State leaking between consumption attempts; `get_output()` returning stale
  or partial data.
- Exceptions/asserts surfacing to the user on normal early termination.
- Final `ModelResponse`/usage missing parts that were streamed.
- Cancellation not cleaning up the underlying provider stream.

## What to Skip

- Provider-specific delta mapping bugs (→ provider mapping sweep).
- Speculation without a deterministic failing reproduction.
- Behavior already tracked by an open issue — **search issues first**.

## Quality Gate — When to Noop

`noop` is the expected outcome most runs. Only file with a deterministic,
minimal, failing streaming reproduction and captured event trace.
