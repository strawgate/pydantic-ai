# Durable Execution with Prefect

[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is a workflow orchestration framework for building resilient data pipelines in Python, natively integrated with Pydantic AI.

## Durable Execution

Prefect 3.0 brings [transactional semantics](https://www.prefect.io/blog/transactional-ml-pipelines-with-prefect-3-0) to your Python workflows, allowing you to group tasks into atomic units and define failure modes. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction can be rolled back to a clean state.

* **Flows** are the top-level entry points for your workflow. They can contain tasks and other flows.
* **Tasks** are individual units of work that can be retried, cached, and monitored independently.

Prefect 3.0's approach to transactional orchestration makes your workflows automatically **idempotent**: rerunnable without duplication or inconsistency across any environment. Every task is executed within a transaction that governs when and where the task's result record is persisted. If the task runs again under an identical context, it will not re-execute but instead load its previous result.

The diagram below shows the overall architecture of an agentic application with Prefect.
Prefect uses client-side task orchestration by default, with optional server connectivity for advanced features like scheduling and monitoring.

## Durable Agent

Add durable execution to any [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent] by attaching the [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] [capability](../capabilities/overview.md). When the agent runs inside a Prefect flow, the capability routes [model requests](../models/overview.md), [tool calls](../tools.md), and [MCP communication](../mcp/client.md) through Prefect tasks. To make a run durable, call `agent.run()` inside a `@flow`.

The agent stays a normal `Agent` everywhere — outside a Prefect flow the capability is transparent, and the original agent, model, and MCP server can still be used as normal.

See [Streaming](#streaming) for event handling inside tasks and flow code.

Here is a simple but complete example of attaching durable execution to an agent. All it requires is to install Pydantic AI with Prefect:

```bash
pip/uv-add pydantic-ai[prefect]
```

Or if you're using the slim package, you can install it with the `prefect` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add pydantic-ai-slim[prefect]
```

```python {title="prefect_durability.py" test="skip"}
from prefect import flow

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect import PrefectDurability

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    instructions="You're an expert in geography.",
    name='geography',  # (1)!
    capabilities=[PrefectDurability()],  # (2)!
)


@flow  # (3)!
async def answer(question: str) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(question)
    return result.output


async def main():
    answer_text = await answer('What is the capital of Mexico?')
    print(answer_text)
    #> Mexico City (Ciudad de México, CDMX)
```

1. The agent's `name` is used to uniquely identify its flows and tasks.
2. Attach durability via `capabilities=[...]`. The capability routes model requests, tool calls, and MCP communication through Prefect tasks when the agent runs inside a flow.
3. Wrap `agent.run()` in your own `@flow` to make the run durable.

_(To run this example, ensure `asyncio` is imported and add `asyncio.run(main())`; no other changes are needed.)_

Because the same agent works inside and outside a Prefect flow, [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] composes with all other [capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) without each needing a Prefect-specific wrapper variant.

For more information on how to use Prefect in Python applications, see their [Python documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/write-and-run).

### Wrapper-agent path (deprecated)

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    [`PrefectAgent`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectAgent] is the original wrapper-agent path for Prefect integration and will be removed in v3. New code should use the [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] capability shown above.

    **When migrating, you must wrap the run in a flow yourself.** `PrefectAgent` wrapped `run` / `run_sync` as a Prefect flow automatically; `PrefectDurability` deliberately does not — a run is only durable when `agent.run()` is called inside your own `@flow`. Porting the constructor arguments but calling `agent.run()` directly produces a run that works but is **not durable**.

    **In-flight flow runs won't resume from cache across the migration.** Task results recorded under `PrefectAgent` key on the task's source code, so a flow run that retries after you deploy the migration re-executes its model requests and tool calls live instead of replaying the recorded results. Let in-flight flow runs finish before switching if re-execution matters to you.

Any agent can be wrapped in a [`PrefectAgent`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectAgent] to get a durable agent variant that routes model requests, tool calls, and MCP communication through Prefect tasks:

```python {title="prefect_agent.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect import PrefectAgent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.6-sol', name='geography')
prefect_agent = PrefectAgent(agent)  # Use `prefect_agent` in place of `agent`.
```

Migrating to the capability means attaching `PrefectDurability` and adding the flow decorator that `PrefectAgent` used to apply for you:

```diff
-prefect_agent = PrefectAgent(agent)
-result = await prefect_agent.run(prompt)
+agent = Agent(..., capabilities=[PrefectDurability()])
+
+@flow
+async def answer(prompt: str) -> str:
+    result = await agent.run(prompt)
+    return result.output
```

## Prefect Integration Considerations

When using Prefect with Pydantic AI agents, there are a few important considerations to ensure workflows behave correctly.

### Agent Requirements

Each agent instance must have a unique `name` so Prefect can correctly identify and track its flows and tasks.

Toolsets that implement their own tool listing and calling (i.e. [`FunctionToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.FunctionToolset], [`MCPToolset`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset], and [`DynamicToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.DynamicToolset]) must have a unique [`id`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset.id] set, which is used to identify their tasks within the flow.

### Capabilities at Runtime

Unlike Temporal and DBOS, Prefect creates a task per call rather than registering its durable units up front, so [capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) passed to `agent.run(capabilities=[...])` inside a flow are accepted. A capability that contributes an executing toolset is still rejected, by the same guard that rejects `run(toolsets=...)`: the toolset arrives after the agent's toolsets were wrapped. Attach those at agent construction time.

### Model Selection at Runtime

[`Agent.run(model=...)`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run] supports both model strings (like `'openai:gpt-5.6-sol'`) and model instances. A model instance can't be serialized across the task boundary, and rebuilding one from its `model_id` string would build a *different* model — the same model name on whatever provider the worker's environment implies, so the request would go to another endpoint with other credentials. An instance that isn't registered ahead of time is therefore rejected with a `UserError`. There are two ways to use a specific instance: pre-register it by passing a `models` dict to [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] and reference it by key (or pass the registered instance), or pass a model-name string and build the instance inside the task with a [`ResolveModelId`](../capabilities/resolve-model-id.md) capability — the right choice when the model depends on the run's `deps`, e.g. per-user credentials. Model-name strings themselves never need registering. The agent's own model, set at construction, is always available as the default.

To customize how a model string is built — a custom provider, or per-user credentials carried on the run's `deps` — add a [`ResolveModelId`](../capabilities/resolve-model-id.md) capability before `PrefectDurability`: it gets first crack at every string, and the resolver runs again inside the task with the run's actual `deps`, so it must be deterministic for a given `(model_id, deps)` and must not perform external I/O.

### Tool Wrapping

Agent tools are automatically wrapped as Prefect tasks, which means they benefit from:

* **Retry logic**: Failed tool calls can be retried automatically
* **Caching**: Tool results are cached based on their inputs
* **Observability**: Tool execution is tracked in the Prefect UI

For a [`DynamicToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.DynamicToolset], including one contributed by a [`DynamicCapability`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.DynamicCapability], tool discovery and each tool call run as Prefect tasks, and flow retries replay recorded discovery and tool results. When the factory is built with `per_run_step=False`, the run resolves the toolset once and each task reuses it, entering it the first time a task needs it and leaving it entered for the rest of the run. Building a toolset is not the same as connecting it — an `MCPToolset` opens nothing until it is entered — so connecting happens inside a task, where it is retried like any other task failure. The factory itself runs in flow code and re-runs whenever that replays, so like the capability factory below it must be deterministic given the run's `deps`: build the toolset in the factory and leave its I/O to the tasks. This is the lifecycle a non-durable run gives the toolset, so a toolset's own caching — such as [`cache_tools`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset.cache_tools] on an `MCPToolset` the factory returns — works as it does outside a flow, instead of being discarded between tasks. A `per_run_step=True` factory is re-resolved inside each task, as it asks to be.

For an [`MCPToolset`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset], tool discovery and each tool call run as Prefect
tasks, and the server is connected inside the first task that needs it rather than in flow code, so a
failed connection is covered by that task's retry policy. The flow then holds the session until the
run ends, so the server is connected once per run and its own
[`cache_tools`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset.cache_tools] answers the later discovery tasks. Concurrent
runs in one process share a server's session, as they do outside a flow, and it is closed once the
last of them ends.

A tool with an [`args_validator`](../tools-advanced.md#args-validator) gets a `Validate Tool Args: {name}` task, so the validator's I/O is checkpointed like the tool call's. A tool without one gets no extra task, and a tool with `metadata={'prefect': False}` is validated in flow code alongside its call. Validation runs before [approval and deferral](../deferred-tools.md), so rejected arguments never reach an approver. Validators can also defer from inside the task; resuming with approval runs validation again with `tool_call_approved` set.

A default [`TaskConfig`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.TaskConfig] for all tools can be passed as `tool_task_config` to the [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] constructor. Per-tool config lives on the tool's [`metadata`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.FunctionToolset.tool] field — `PrefectDurability` looks for a `'prefect'` key. You can set the metadata directly on the tool definition, or apply it across a selection of tools via the [`SetToolMetadata`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.SetToolMetadata] capability. See the [capabilities documentation][pydantic_ai.capabilities.SetToolMetadata] for the full selector vocabulary.

```python {title="prefect_per_tool_config.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import SetToolMetadata
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect import PrefectDurability, TaskConfig
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset

toolset = FunctionToolset(id='research')


@toolset.tool(metadata={'prefect': TaskConfig(timeout_seconds=10.0)})  # (1)!
def fetch_data(url: str) -> str: ...


@toolset.tool(metadata={'prefect': False})  # (2)!
def simple_tool() -> str: ...


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    name='research',
    toolsets=[toolset],
    capabilities=[
        SetToolMetadata(  # (3)!
            tools=['fetch_data', 'fetch_dataset'],
            prefect=TaskConfig(timeout_seconds=10.0),
        ),
        PrefectDurability(tool_task_config=TaskConfig(retries=3)),  # (4)!
    ],
)
```

1. Inline: declare the task config alongside the tool definition. Per-tool config merges on top of the base `tool_task_config`.
2. Set `'prefect': False` to skip task wrapping entirely for that tool.
3. Selector-based: [`SetToolMetadata`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.SetToolMetadata] applies the same metadata across a selection of tools (`'all'`, a name list, a dict, or a callable).
4. `tool_task_config` sets the default config for every tool.

This opt-out applies to function and dynamic tools only. MCP tools perform I/O and always run in
their Prefect task, so `metadata={'prefect': False}` on an MCP tool raises a `UserError`.

### Streaming

[`Agent.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream], [`Agent.run_stream_events()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream_events], and [`Agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.iter] work inside a Prefect flow, but their events are buffered rather than delivered in real time. The model stream runs inside the durable task, and its events are replayed to the flow after the task completes.

For handlers with I/O side effects, pass `event_stream_handler=` to [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability]. Model events are delivered live inside each model-request task, while each tool event is delivered in its own event-handler task. Configure those per-event tasks with `event_stream_handler_task_config=`. As with any Prefect task, a handler may run more than once if a task retries, so keep its side effects idempotent.

Alternatively, register [`ProcessEventStream`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ProcessEventStream]. Its handler runs in flow code and must be deterministic because it re-runs on flow replay. Tool and final-output events arrive live, while the real captured model events are replayed after each model request completes. For examples, see the [streaming docs](../agent.md#streaming-all-events).

A durability `event_stream_handler=` and a separately registered `ProcessEventStream` are two distinct handlers, and each fires once. The durability handler receives live events inside the durable task, while `ProcessEventStream` sees the buffered replay in flow code.

A per-run handler passed to `Agent.run(event_stream_handler=...)` also runs flow-side against replayed model events.

Events emitted with [`ctx.emit()`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.emit] from inside a durable task — including a [capability event](../capabilities/overview.md#capability-events) emitted by a capability's own tool — are delivered when the task actually runs, and are *not* re-emitted when its recorded result is replayed on a flow retry or cache hit. Like a log line written inside a task, an emitted event is a side effect of running the task rather than part of its recorded result. Emit from flow-level code, such as a [capability](../capabilities/overview.md) hook, if a listener must see the event on every attempt. Capability listeners registered with [`@on_event`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.on_event] run in flow code rather than in a task, so they re-run on a flow retry and must be deterministic; keep I/O in a durability `event_stream_handler=`, which runs in its own task. Unlike [`ctx.enqueue()`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue], which is rejected inside a task because dropping it would change what the model sees, a missed event only means an observer wasn't notified. Carrying a durable unit's emitted events in its recorded output, so a replay reproduces them, is tracked in [pydantic-ai#7971](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/7971).

Because the model stream is consumed inside the task, cancelling it from the flow side (e.g. with [`AgentStream.cancel()`][pydantic_ai.result.AgentStream.cancel]) is not available across the durable boundary.

[`CancellationToken`][pydantic_ai.CancellationToken] and [`RunContext.cancel()`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.cancel] are same-process cancellation handles and cannot cross the Prefect durable boundary; cancel the Prefect flow instead.

[`Agent.run_stream_sync()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream_sync] is not for flow code: it requires no running event loop and wraps `run_stream()`. Under [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability], use the buffered async streaming APIs above or [`Agent.run()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run] with an event stream handler. Outside a flow, an agent with `PrefectDurability` behaves like a normal agent, so `run_stream_sync()` works as usual. (Wrapper `PrefectAgent` forbids `run_stream` inside flows — use `run` + event stream handler there.)

### Suspended Turns and Background Mode

When a provider pauses a model turn mid-flight (Anthropic `pause_turn`) or runs it as a server-side job that's polled until it's ready ([OpenAI background mode](../models/openai.md#background-mode)), each segment runs in a separate model request task. The suspended [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse] and background job ID are checkpointed between segments, while the final response is merged and usage is recorded once. A [`message_history`](../message-history.md) ending in a suspended response is passed to the first task. Size `timeout_seconds` in [Task Configuration](#task-configuration) for one provider round trip. If an error abandons a suspended job, its provider teardown runs in a dedicated cancellation task.

### Toolsets at Runtime

Pass every executing toolset that needs durable wrapping to the agent constructor so its tasks are registered before the flow runs. This includes [`DynamicToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.DynamicToolset]: give it an explicit `id` and pass it to `Agent(toolsets=[...])`. The [`@agent.toolset`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.toolset] decorator registers after the engine's durable units were created, so under [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] using it inside a flow raises a `UserError`. The deprecated `PrefectAgent` doesn't run this check: inside a flow it runs the task-wrapped toolset list frozen at wrap time, so a toolset registered that late is silently left out of the run.

Additional toolsets can be passed per run via `agent.run(toolsets=...)`, but only toolsets that don't need durable wrapping are supported: non-executing toolsets like [`ExternalToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.ExternalToolset], whose tools are executed outside the agent run, and [`FunctionToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.FunctionToolset]s whose tools all opt out of task wrapping with `metadata={'prefect': False}`. Other executing toolsets ([`FunctionToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.FunctionToolset] and [`MCPToolset`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset]) and dynamic toolsets passed at runtime raise a `UserError`.

Toolsets swapped in with [`agent.override(toolsets=...)`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.override] inside a flow are held to the same rule, as they also arrive after the agent's tasks were registered. A toolset added at runtime also cannot reuse the `id` of one the agent was constructed with, as the `id` is what identifies which registered toolset's task a tool call is dispatched to.

## Task Configuration

You can customize Prefect task behavior, such as retries and timeouts, by passing [`TaskConfig`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.TaskConfig] objects to the [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability] constructor:

- `mcp_task_config`: Configuration for MCP server communication tasks
- `model_task_config`: Configuration for model request tasks
- `event_stream_handler_task_config`: Configuration for event stream handler tasks
- `tool_task_config`: Default configuration for all tool calls (per-tool overrides go on the tool's `'prefect'` metadata — see [Tool Wrapping](#tool-wrapping) above)

Available `TaskConfig` options:

- `retries`: Maximum number of retries for the task (default: `0`)
- `retry_delay_seconds`: Delay between retries in seconds (can be a single value or list for exponential backoff, default: `1.0`)
- `timeout_seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for the task to complete
- `cache_policy`: Custom Prefect cache policy for the task
- `persist_result`: Whether to persist the task result
- `result_storage`: Prefect result storage for the task (e.g., `'s3-bucket/my-storage'` or a `WritableFileSystem` block)
- `log_prints`: Whether to log print statements from the task (default: `False`)

Example:

```python {title="prefect_durability_task_config.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect import PrefectDurability, TaskConfig

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    instructions="You're an expert in geography.",
    name='geography',
    capabilities=[
        PrefectDurability(
            model_task_config=TaskConfig(
                retries=3,
                retry_delay_seconds=[1.0, 2.0, 4.0],  # Exponential backoff
                timeout_seconds=30.0,
            ),
        ),
    ],
)


async def main():
    result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
    print(result.output)
    #> Paris
```

_(To run this example, ensure `asyncio` is imported and add `asyncio.run(main())`; no other changes are needed.)_

### Retry Considerations

Pydantic AI and provider API clients have their own retry logic. When using Prefect, you may want to:

* Disable [transport retries](../retries.md#transport-retries) in Pydantic AI
* Turn off your provider API client's retry logic (e.g., `max_retries=0` on a [custom OpenAI client](../models/openai.md#custom-openai-client))
* Rely on Prefect's task-level retry configuration for consistency

This prevents requests from being retried multiple times at different layers. The layers *multiply*: see [Retry multiplication](../retries.md#retry-multiplication) for the arithmetic.

## Caching and Idempotency

Prefect 3.0 provides built-in caching and transactional semantics. Tasks with identical inputs will not re-execute if their results are already cached, making workflows naturally idempotent and resilient to failures.

!!! warning "Dynamic-tool cache keys changed"
    Dynamic-tool task keys now include the prepared tool definition. Existing cached results for dynamic tools will miss once after upgrading and recompute. No manual cache deletion is required; subsequent calls reuse the new value-addressed keys.

* **Task inputs**: A model request's messages, settings and parameters; a tool call's name, arguments, definition and [`tool_call_id`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.tool_call_id] (so two parallel calls to the same tool with the same arguments each execute); and the run state the task's work can depend on: dependencies, [`metadata`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.metadata], [`validation_context`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.validation_context], the prompt, and the message history.

Per-run identifiers like [`run_id`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.run_id] and [`conversation_id`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.conversation_id], and message timestamps, are deliberately left out, so an otherwise identical run replays recorded results instead of re-executing them.

**Note**: For user dependencies, `metadata` and `validation_context` to be included in cache keys, they must be serializable (e.g., Pydantic models or basic Python types). Non-serializable values are automatically excluded from cache computation.

## Observability with Prefect and Logfire

Prefect provides a built-in UI for monitoring flow runs, task executions, and failures. You can:

* View real-time flow run status
* Debug failures with full stack traces
* Set up alerts and notifications

To access the Prefect UI, you can either:

1. Use [Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud) (managed service)
2. Run a local [Prefect server](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/self-hosted/server-cli) with `prefect server start`

You can also use [Pydantic Logfire](../logfire.md) for detailed observability. When using both Prefect and Logfire, you'll get complementary views:

* **Prefect**: Workflow-level orchestration, task status, and retry history
* **Logfire**: Fine-grained tracing of agent runs, model requests, and tool invocations

When using Logfire with Prefect, you can enable distributed tracing to see spans for your Prefect runs included with your agent runs, model requests, and tool invocations.

For more information about Prefect monitoring, see the [Prefect documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/).

## Deployments and Scheduling

To deploy and schedule a Prefect-durable agent, wrap it in a Prefect flow and use the flow's [`serve()`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments#create-a-deployment-with-serve) or [`deploy()`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/deploy-via-python) methods:

```python {title="serve_agent.py" test="skip"}
from prefect import flow

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect import PrefectDurability


@flow
async def daily_report_flow(user_prompt: str):
    """Generate a daily report using the agent."""
    agent = Agent(  # (1)!
        'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
        name='daily_report_agent',
        instructions='Generate a daily summary report.',
        capabilities=[PrefectDurability()],
    )

    result = await agent.run(user_prompt)
    return result.output

1. Each flow run executes in an isolated process, and all inputs and dependencies must be serializable. Because Agent instances cannot be serialized, instantiate the agent inside the flow rather than at the module level.

The `serve()` method accepts scheduling options:

- **`cron`**: Cron schedule string (e.g., `'0 9 * * *'` for daily at 9am)
- **`interval`**: Schedule interval in seconds or as a timedelta
- **`rrule`**: iCalendar RRule schedule string

For production deployments with Docker, Kubernetes, or other infrastructure, use the flow's [`deploy()`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/deploy-via-python) method. See the [Prefect deployment documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deploymentsy) for more information.
