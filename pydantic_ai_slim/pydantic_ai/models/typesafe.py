    """A model that fills a structured `output_type` with one request to a TypeSafe Jev model.

    Jev does not generate text. It answers typed questions about a text, each with a confidence. This model
    turns the output type's fields into those questions and the user prompt into the text, so an agent whose
    job is to classify runs on it like on any other model:

    ```python
    from typing import Literal

    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

    from pydantic_ai import Agent


    class Handling(BaseModel):
        verdict: Literal['run', 'reject', 'ask'] = Field(description='How to handle this command.')
        irreversible: bool = Field(description='Would running this destroy data or leak secrets?')


    agent = Agent('typesafe:jev-latest', output_type=Handling)
    ...
    ```

    Each field is one question, all sent in one request:

    | Field type | Question | Answer |
    |---|---|---|
    | `bool` | yes or no | `True` when Jev's probability is at least 0.5 |
    | `Literal[...]` or `Enum` of strings | pick one | the chosen option |
    | `float` with `ge=0` and `le=1` | yes or no | Jev's probability |
    | whole numbers 0, 1, 2, … with a description per level in the schema | score against a rubric | the nearest level |
    | `list` of a `Literal` or `Enum` | one yes or no per option | the options Jev said yes to |
    | a nested model of these | its fields, named `outer.inner` | the model |
    | `Literal[...]` or `Enum`, or `None` | pick one, or none of these | the option, or `None` |

    The field description is the question. The output type's docstring and the agent's instructions go along
    as context. An option is described by a description on its value in the schema, and by its name without one.
    A bare `bool`, `Literal` or `float` output has no field to describe, so there the agent's instructions are the
    question.
    Confidence per field, from 0 for undecided to 1, is in
    [`ModelResponse.provider_details`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse.provider_details] under `confidence`,
    the full distribution of each pick-one and rubric field under `probabilities`, and each rubric field's
    unrounded position along its levels under `scores`.

    The latest user prompt is the text Jev judges, and is the whole state on its own. Everything before it in
    the message history, from any model, goes along beside it as `history`: user prompts, answers, tool calls
    and their results, and retry prompts.

    Jev cannot write a tool's arguments, but it can tell which tool the text calls for. With tools attached, one
    more question asks which, the output type first among the options, described by its docstring or the agent's
    instructions. A tool that takes no arguments, or an output function that takes nothing but the run context,
    is called on Jev's pick, so it can run a loop of such tools and hand a run off to an output function on its
    own. A tool with arguments, picked at or above
    `typesafe_tool_call_threshold`, is raised as [`ToolCallProposed`][pydantic_ai.models.typesafe.ToolCallProposed],
    which a [`FallbackModel`][pydantic_ai.models.fallback.FallbackModel] with a language model behind Jev hands
    that model, tools and all.

    Jev answers in one piece, so a streamed run gets the whole answer as one event rather than failing.

    Anything else Jev cannot do is refused with a [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError] before a
    request is sent: text output, other field types, native tools, and files in the prompt or history.

    Sampling settings like `temperature` do not apply and are ignored. `timeout`, `extra_headers` and
    `extra_body` are forwarded.

    Apart from `__init__`, all methods are private or match those of the base class.
