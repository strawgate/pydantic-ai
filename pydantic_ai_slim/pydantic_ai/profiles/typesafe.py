    Jev answers typed questions about a state; it does not generate text, call tools, or read
    anything but text. Tool-mode structured output is how
    [`TypeSafeModel`][pydantic_ai.models.typesafe.TypeSafeModel] fills an `output_type`, and it rides on
    `supports_tools`, so that stays on. A system prompt anywhere in the history is part of what Jev judges, so it
    needs no wrapping. Every other capability flag is off, and what no flag covers, such as a file in a prompt,
    the model refuses itself.
